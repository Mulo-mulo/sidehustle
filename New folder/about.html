          <p>
National Heritage Conservation Commission (NHCC) is a statutory body under the Ministry of Tourism and Arts charged with the responsibility of conserving Zambia’s natural and cultural heritage for research, sustainable tourism development, education and enjoyment of all the people now in the future.

The NHCC is the name for what until 29th December 1989 was known as the Commission for the preservation of Natural and Historical Monuments (National Monuments Commission), a national organization entrusted with the conservation of Zambia’s natural and cultural heritage. Together with its antecedents, the Commission Act has been in existence since 1912 when Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) came into being.
		</p>
		<ul>
		
    <li><p>>1912 Bushman’s Relics Proclamation No. 15. This Act protected Bushmen relics. Aboriginal objects and ancient ruins</p></li>
    <li><p>>1930 Preservation of Archaeological Objects Ordinance number 5 later CAP 146 of the Laws of Zambia mainly for the protection of archaeological objects. This introduced a provision for declaration of ‘reserve areas’. It also prohibited removal, excavation or mining which threatened to destroy objects of archaeological and paleontological interest. It also protected from disturbance or destruction all caves, buildings, or graves of archaeological or paleontological interest. Mining and prospecting interest, however, took precedence.</p></li>
    <li><p>>1947 Ancient Monuments Ordinance number 36 renamed Natural and Historical Monuments and Relics CAP 90 in 1952, later CAP 266, which protected all pre-1890 historical, archaeological or cultural sites, objects and structures. Mining still took precedence. It also introduced in the 1952 Ordinance a provision for declaring National Monuments and the protection of natural sites. Altogether 74 national Monuments were declared by the time of its repeal in 1989.</p></li>
    <li><p>>1989 December 29th National Heritage Conservation Commission Act CAP 173 was enacted.</p></li>
		</ul>
		
<p>This Act brought forward the automatic protection of all Heritage from 1st January 1924. Whereas 1890 signified the white pioneer column into Rhodesia, 1924 was the first British Government direct rule of Northern Rhodesia. This Act introduced new technologies of “heritage” instead of “Monument”. It also introduced stiffer penalties for violation of the Act and for the first time a provision for the payment of impact assessment costs by developers whose projects impact upon heritage was introduced.</p>

<p>In 1997 NHCC decentralized its operations to the creation of four cost centres namely East-Central Region, Southwest Region, Northwest Region and Northern Region with their respective Regional Head-offices in Lusaka, Livingstone, Solwezi and Kasama. The four regions are strategically located to ensure effective and efficient heritage conservation by cost effective management and implementation of conservation programmes, full geographical coverage and increased documentation and management in each.</p>          

          
		  
		  <h1 class="page-title">NHCC Act</h1>
          <p>
		  The NHCC has the following powers and functions enshrined in its Act:</p>
	<ul>
		
    <li><p>>To preserve, protect and manage Zambia’s natural and cultural (i.e. the prehistoric, historic and contemporary monuments and relics) heritage. At present there are over 4,000 such sites recorded and hundreds of thousands of such relics inventoried, all of which are protected.</p></li>
    <li><p>Declaration of some of this heritage as national monuments ensures that they are protected in perpetuity. There are so far over 80 declared monuments ,and many more are due for declaration. Listing, recording and inventorying of this heritage is an on-going activity of the National Heritage Conservation Commission.</p></li>
    <li><p>>To present Zambia’s heritage to the public, this means to develop and provide facilities at national monuments for tourist purposes.</p></li>
    <li><p>>To encourage and promote the preservation and protection of that heritage so as to create a more likely awareness of the public of the irreplaceable value of their heritage and the grave dangers which threaten it;</p></li>
    <li><p>>To erect commemorative plaques and standard monuments at certain spots or places of importance in the nation’s history, giving information about historic events which occurred at such places.</p></li>
    <li><p>>To purchase or otherwise acquire any monument or relic if it is in the best national interest for its preservation;</p></li>
	<li><p>>To assume guardianship of any monument or relic if so requested by the person owning or controlling such a monument or relic and as trustees for the government to accept any such monument or relic which the owner desires to give or has bequeathed to the government;</p></li>
	<li><p>>To control the movement and export of heritage objects (relics) and to lend or donate such objects to any museum or public institution for the purpose of displaying to the public and preservation; and,</p></li>
	<li><p>>Finally to co-ordinate all activities in connection with monuments and relics in order that monuments and relics are restored and exhibited to the public as tokens of the past and may serve as an inspiration for the future.</p></li>
          </p>
