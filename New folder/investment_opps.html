		  Lake Chilengwa is another one of the sunken lakes in the Copperbelt
		  Province. It lies near the top of the ridge of schist about 16km
		  east of Ndola and about 3km west of the border with the Democratic 
		  Republic of Congo. The center-like Lake was formed as a result of the 
		  schistose rock collapsing into a large underground cavern in the 
		  underlying limestone. The lake is roughly circular with a diameter of 
		  450 meters with a buffer zone of 500 meters around it. The sides of the 
		  lake are steeply sloping though there are a few walking trails leading
		  down to the water level. The water level is about 34 meters below the
		  surrounding ground, while the greates depth of the lake is approximated 21 
		  meters. Like Lake Kishiba, the lake is assoiciated with a number of 
		  legends and is held in reverence by the local people.
